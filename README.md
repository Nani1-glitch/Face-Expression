### README for Facial Expression Recognition ðŸŽ­ðŸ¤–

#### Overview
This GitHub repository hosts the Facial Expression Recognition project, which leverages machine learning to identify human emotions from facial expressions. Built using Python and HTML, the system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and utilizes a trained model to classify expressions in real-time through a web interface.

#### Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Recognizes and classifies facial expressions live.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a CNN model for accurate emotion detection.
- **Web Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for interaction and results display.

#### Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**: Access all the project files.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Execute the Program**: Run `python app.py` to start the web server and use the application.

#### How to Contribute
Contributions are encouraged! Improve code, update documentation, or suggest new features through GitHub pull requests.

#### License
The project is open-source, under the MIT license, promoting free use and distribution.

Explore, fork, and star the project for exciting insights into real-time emotion detection using facial recognition technology!
